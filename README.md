# Sprouljobdata

Josh Sproul

Program is run by calling it from the cmd line

How do I do each of the operations:
  Create- Click the create record button and fill in the desired fields, Click submit.
  Update- Click the update button and ammend the desired fields, Click submit.
  Delete- Click the delete button.
  
A paragraph comparing how easy/hard this was to do with squlite3 compared to just using excel:
  I found using sql to be much easier to use than working with the excel file directly. With its vast amount of built in features, using the sql DB allows for easier implementation of the add, update and delete buttons. 
  
Anything left undone:
Working on map implementation and converting to web assembly.
